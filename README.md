# Great Neovim Setup for Web Development

## Requirements (MacOS/Homebrew)

_LazyVim is the package manager_

- Node.js Latest

```
    brew install node
```

- Ripgrep

```
    brew install ripgrep
```

- Nerd Font

```
    brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
```

```
    brew install --cask font-jetbrains-mono-nerd-font
```

- Lazygit

```
    brew install jesseduffield/lazygit/lazygit
```

- Neovim 0.10.0 or higher

```
    brew install neovim
```

This setup was based on [Josean Martinez](https://www.josean.com) and [Typecraft](https://www.typecraft.dev/)

_I didn't add install steps for any Linux distro package manager, because there is many options._
